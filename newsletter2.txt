Hello everyone.

Before you read any further, I want to ask you to answer this question for yourself: how are YOU doing? Like, geuninely. I know some people reading this have some bad experiences with life. I know some of you are even thinking about s****de.
All I ask from you is to never think about that again. I want you to try. I want you to be happy.
Even though I'm only 13 and haven't experienced anything you have, my DMs, #venting (papyrus) and #members-chat (talalaa) are always open for you to talk about any and all of your problems and struggles, however small or big they may be. And if you have any, I **URGE** you to talk about them. It'll be hard, but just trust me on that.

Anyways.

========= SECTION ONE: SOCIAL LIFE ==========
My social life has been going pretty well recently! Went to the movies with my "primary-school-best friend (female version)", as I called her in the first newsletter, planning to go to the movies with my "primary-school-best friend", and just doing random activities with my sister when either one of us is bored. I've honestly got nothing to complain about right now.

========= SECTION TWO: other stuff ==========
Yeah. The newsletter is that short.
So as some of you mayyyyyyy have noticed, Discord can shove their localized age restrictions right up their ass. I'm not leaving anytime soon.
Secondly: my channel is getting revived! I'm gonna post some cool stuff at https://www.youtube.com/@Space_Vis, including Undertale, Deltarune and... chess. Yes, chess. And lots of other games.
And lastly... thank you all for the support <3
